= Lab 4: Introduction to Variables, Facts, Includes and Registered Variables

In this lab we will continue our journey with Ansible by learning about variables, facts, and includes.

== Variables in Ansible

There are multiple ways that variables can be utilized in Ansible to store values that can be
reused to simplify the creation and maintenance of a project while reducing errors.

Using variables provide a convenient way to manage dynamic values for a given environment in your
Ansible project. Some examples of values that variables might contain include:

* file names
* file paths
* URLs

=== Naming variables

Variables should have names which consist of a string that must start with a letter and can
only contain letters, numbers, and underscores. Here is a list of variables named using the correct terminology:

* user_name
* file_1
* file_2
* openstack_api_url

=== Defining variables

You could define variables in multiple ways for the execution, and there are three scope levels where a variable could be defined:

* Global scope: Global scope variables are set from the command line or in the Ansible configuration file
* Play scope: Play scope variables are set in the play and related structures
* Host scope: Host scope variables are set on host groups and individual hosts by the inventory, fact gathering, or registered tasks

There is something fundamental to know when defining variables: if the same variable name is set at
more than one level, the higher level wins. Here is an example: if the variable openstack_api_url is
defined by the inventory, it could be overridden if the same variable is defined in the playbook,
and that could be overridden if defined on the command line.

==== Variables in Playbooks

You could define variables in playbooks, for example, a variable *service_name*
can be defined with a value of **mongod**. This could be defined in
multiple ways, as shown below:

* In vars block at the beginning of Playbook:

[source,]
----
- hosts: db
  vars:
    service_name: mongod
    volume_name: dbvol
    db_vol_path: /var/lib/mongodb
    device_path: /dev/vdb
    cloud: devstack
----

* In an external variable file:

[source,]
----
- hosts: localhost
  vars_files:
    - vars/db_vars.yml
----

Inside the variable file, variables are defined in YAML format:

[source,]
----
service_name: mongod
volume_name: dbvol
db_vol_path: /var/lib/mongodb
device_path: /dev/vdb
cloud: devstack
----

To use the variables, you need to reference it inside double curly braces
i.e. _{{ <var_name> }}_. Ansible will substitute the variable with its value when
the task is executed:

[source,]
----
---
- hosts: db
  vars_files:
    - vars/db_vars.yml
  tasks:
  - name: Stop the {{ service_name }} database
    systemd:
      name: "{{ service_name }}"
      state: stopped
  - name: Unmount the database volume
    mount:
      path: "{{ db_vol_path }}"
      state: unmounted
...
----

In the previous example, we are using some of the variables declared
within our _vars/db_vars.yml_ file.

NOTE: Quotes are very important when declaring variables as the first element starting the value. If missing
you will get an error.

==== Host Variables and Group Variables

There are two other types of variables in Ansible that are applied at the
inventory level. They are __host variables__ and __group variables__. _group_variables_
apply to an entire group of hosts. There variables are typically defined in static
inventory files or from dynamic inventory scripts. Below is an example of using a
static inventory file. Note that a static inventory file is in INI format,
not the YAML we've been using up to now. The difference is key/value pairs are separated by
**=** instead of **:**.

* Here is an example for a host variable:

[source,]
----
[db_servers]
db0.example.com ansible_user=db
----

* Here is an example for a group variable:

[source,]
----
[web_servers]
web0.example.com
web1.example.com

[web_servers:vars]
ansible_user=web
----

For more detail on host and group variables, please
visit: http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_inventory.html#host-variables[here] .

=== Facts

Facts in Ansible are variables that are automatically discovered. Facts
contain host-specific information that can be used just like regular variables.

Some of the facts gathered for a managed host might include:

* Host name
* Kernel version
* IP addresses
* OS version
* and more...

Every play runs the setup module automatically before the first task to gather
facts from the managed node. You don't need to have a task to run setup in your
play; it is automatically run for you by Ansible.

Here is an example playbook that shows the running kernel and hostname of a
system:

[source,]
----
---
- hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Prints various Ansible facts
      debug:
        msg: >
          The running Kernel of {{ ansible_hostname }}
          is {{ ansible_kernel }}
----

While the ansible_hostname variable provides the FQDN of a host, if you are looking
for the shortname of a host, you can replace the ansible_hostname variable with
inventory_hostname_short.

please visit: http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/setup_module.html

For more details about facts: http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_variables.html#information-discovered-from-systems-facts

=== Includes

A best practice when writing complex or lengthy playbooks is to use separate
files to divide tasks and lists of variables for more natural management.
There are multiple ways to include task files and variables in a playbook.

* Tasks can be included in a playbook from an external file:

[source,]
----
 tasks:
   - name: Initial preparation for Cinder volume restoration
     include: tasks/cinder_vol_prep.yml
   - name: Restoring a Cinder backup volume
     include: tasks/cinder_vol_restore.yml
----

Also, you could use the _include_vars_ as previously shown to include variables
from JSON or YAML files:

[source,]
----
- hosts: localhost
  vars_files:
    - vars/db_vars.yml
----

Using multiple, external files for tasks and variables is a convenient way to
build the main playbook in a modular way. You could use the *include* directive
to have a task file inserted at a particular point in a playbook. This also allows
you to reuse common sets of tasks across different playbooks.

== Registered Variables

At times there might be a set of output that a particular Ansible task does
that you want to capture. In order to capture this value, we need to store it
in a variable using the `register` statement.

An example from the Ansible documentation is shown below.

----
   tasks:

     - name: Run a script named foo
       shell: /usr/bin/foo
       register: foo_result

     - name: Run a script named bar
       shell: /usr/bin/bar
       when: foo_result.rc == 5
----

The first task runs a script named foo and captures the result of foo and
stores it in a variable labeled _foo_result_. The second task that runs a script
named bar only executes when the return code (rc) of foo_result is equal to 5.

If interested in seeing the different types of values that a registered variable
can return, you may use the `debug` module to display it.

An example is shown below.

----
   tasks:

     - name: Run a script named foo
       shell: /usr/bin/foo
       register: foo_result

     - name: debugging the variable foo_result
       debug:
         var: foo_result
----

Due to time limitations, we will not cover:

- Tags
- Special variables

Be sure to visit the http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/index.html[Ansible]
documentation for more details.

== Guided Exercise: Ansible Playbook - Restoring a Database using Cinder

With a brief introduction to variables, facts, and includes we will take an
existing playbook and modify it so that it is taking advantage of what we just
learned.

In this exercise the objectives are:

* Create a variable file that consists of all the variables we will use in this
newly created playbook.
* Create two task files breaking up the process of restoring a cinder volume.
** The first task file will handle the following tasks:
*** Stopping the MongoDB database
*** Umounting the database volume
*** Detaching the volume from the server
** The second task file will handle the following tasks:
*** Restoring the Cinder backup volume
*** Waiting for the restore of the database volume
*** Reattaching the volume to the database server
*** Starting the MongoDB database
* Create a task that outputs the hostname and kernel of the server web0.

Playbook that needs modification is specified below.

NOTE: When unsure how to use a particular module, be sure to use the `ansible-doc`
command. For example, if we wanted to find more information about the `systemd`
module, within our console we could run the command: `ansible-doc systemd`

.mod-me-playbook.yml
----
---
- hosts: db
  tasks:
  - name: Stop the MongoDB database
    systemd:
      name: mongod
      state: stopped
    become: true
  - name: Unmount the database volume
    mount:
      path: /var/lib/mongodb
      state: unmounted
    become: true
  - name: Detach volume from server
    os_server_volume:
      state: absent
      cloud: devstack
      server: db0
      volume: dbvol
    delegate_to: localhost
  - name: Restore Cinder backup volume
    command: "openstack volume backup restore dbvol_backup dbvol"
    delegate_to: localhost
    register: vol_restore
    failed_when:
    - vol_restore.rc > 0
    - "'VolumeBackupsRestore' not in vol_restore.stderr"
  - name: Wait for the restore of the database volume
    command: "openstack volume show -c status -f value dbvol"
    register: restore_progress
    until: restore_progress.stdout is search("available")
    retries: 60
    delay: 5
    delegate_to: localhost
  - name: Reattach volume to the database server
    os_server_volume:
      state: present
      server: db0
      cloud: devstack
      volume: dbvol
      device: /dev/vdb
    delegate_to: localhost
  - name: Mount the database volume
    mount:
      path: /var/lib/mongodb
      state: mounted
      src: LABEL=dbvol
      fstype: xfs
    become: true
  - name: Start the MongoDB database
    systemd:
      name: mongod
      state: started
    become: true
...
----

The first step of the process is to identify everything in the existing Ansible
playbook that we can create variables for. Once we have identified our variables,
we will create a _vars_ directory with a file labeled _db_vars.yml_ to store
that information.

On the OVH instance, create a vars/db_vars.yml file

----
$ cd $HOME/openstack-ansible
$ mkdir vars
$ vi vars/db_vars.yml
service_name: mongod
volume_name: dbvol
db_vol_path: /var/lib/mongodb
device_path: /dev/vdb
----

Next, we will create a tasks file that will breakup the existing Ansible playbook
into two segments. One segment is to prepare the environment for the Cinder restore
and the other segment will do the actual Cinder volume restoration.

----
$ cd $HOME/openstack-ansible
$ mkdir tasks
----

In the initial instructions, it mentioned the first task file should include:

* Stopping the MongoDB database
* Umounting the database volume
* Detaching the volume from the server

From the existing playbook, this currently looks as:

----
- name: Stop the MongoDB database
  systemd:
    name: mongod
    state: stopped
- name: Unmount the database volume
  mount:
    path: /var/lib/mongodb
    state: unmounted
- name: Detach volume from server
  os_server_volume:
    state: absent
    cloud: devstack
    server: db0
    volume: dbvol
  delegate_to: localhost
----

Within the task directory, create a file labeled _cinder_restore_prep.yml_ and
take the above snippet and place it into this newly created yml file and modify
values with variables were appropriate. The final result will be similar to:

.cinder_restore_prep.yml
----
- name: Stop the MongoDB database
  systemd:
    name: "{{ service_name }}"
    state: stopped
  become: true
- name: Unmount the database volume
  mount:
    path: "{{ db_vol_path }}"
    state: unmounted
  become: true
- name: Detach volume from server
  os_server_volume:
    state: absent
    cloud: "{{ cloud }}"
    server: "{{ inventory_hostname_short }}"
    volume: "{{ volume_name }}"
  delegate_to: localhost
----

Next, within the same task directory, create a file named _cinder_restore.yml_
that captures the following tasks:

* Restoring the Cinder backup volume
* Waiting for the restore of the database volume
* Reattaching the volume to the database server
* Starting the MongoDB database

Those tasks within the original Ansible playbook look as follows:

----
- name: Restore Cinder backup volume
  command: "openstack volume backup restore dbvol_backup dbvol"
  delegate_to: localhost
  register: vol_restore
  failed_when:
  - vol_restore.rc > 0
  - "'VolumeBackupsRestore' not in vol_restore.stderr"
  become: true
- name: Wait for the restore of the database volume
  command: "openstack volume show -c status -f value dbvol"
  register: restore_progress
  until: restore_progress.stdout is search("available")
  retries: 60
  delay: 5
  delegate_to: localhost
- name: Reattach volume to the database server
  os_server_volume:
    state: present
    server: db0
    cloud: devstack
    volume: dbvol
    device: /dev/vdb
  delegate_to: localhost
- name: Mount the database volume
  mount:
    path: /var/lib/mongodb
    state: mounted
    src: LABEL=dbvol
    fstype: xfs
  become: true
- name: Start the MongoDB database
  systemd:
    name: mongod
    state: started
  become: true
----

Modify the above tasks with variables where appropriate. For example, changing
server: db0 to server: "{{ inventory_hostname_short }}" The final result when the changes
are completed will be similar to:


.cinder_restore.yml
----
- name: Restore Cinder backup volume
  command: "openstack volume backup restore dbvol_backup dbvol"
  delegate_to: localhost
  register: vol_restore
  failed_when:
  - vol_restore.rc > 0
  - "'VolumeBackupsRestore' not in vol_restore.stderr"
- name: Wait for the restore of the database volume
  command: "openstack volume show -c status -f value dbvol"
  register: restore_progress
  until: restore_progress.stdout is search("available")
  retries: 60
  delay: 5
  delegate_to: localhost
- name: Reattach volume to the database server
  os_server_volume:
    state: present
    cloud: "{{ cloud }}"
    server: "{{ inventory_hostname_short }}"
    volume: "{{ volume_name }}"
    device: "{{ device_path }}"
  delegate_to: localhost
- name: Mount the database volume
  mount:
    path: "{{ db_vol_path }}"
    state: mounted
    src: LABEL=dbvol
    fstype: xfs
  become: true
- name: Start the MongoDB database
  systemd:
    name: "{{ service_name }}"
    state: started
  become: true
----

NOTE: The variable labeled `inventory_hostname_short` is the shortname of the
host. This is a special variable that is part of Ansible facts.

Now with a variables file (_db_vars.yml_), and two task files
(_cinder_restore_prep.yml_ and _cinder_restore.yml_) we can create an Ansible
playbook that includes these files. This will simplify the readability and
manageability of your playbooks.

Create an example playbook under `$HOME/openstack-ansible` by combining all the files. Example below.

.simplified_cinder_restore.yml
----
---
- hosts: db
  vars_files:
    - vars/db_vars.yml
  tasks:
    - name: Initial preparation for Cinder volume restoration
      include: tasks/cinder_restore_prep.yml
    - name: Restoring a Cinder backup volume
      include: tasks/cinder_restore.yml
...
----

Lastly, the final step will take advantage of using Ansible facts. The request
is to create a task that outputs the hostname and kernel of the server web0.
In order to successfully do this, we will need to use the `delegate_to` keyword
to assign the specific task to be run on the web0. Below is an example snippet:

----
- name: Prints various Ansible facts
  debug:
    msg: >
      The running Kernel of {{ ansible_hostname }}
      is {{ ansible_kernel }}
  delegate_to: web0
----

The final version of our newly transformed Ansible playbook looks as follows:

.Newly Transformed Ansible Cinder Restore Playbook
----
---
- hosts: db
  vars_files:
    - vars/db_vars.yml
  tasks:
    - name: Initial preparation for Cinder volume restoration
      include: tasks/cinder_restore_prep.yml
    - name: Restoring a Cinder backup volume
      include: tasks/cinder_restore.yml
    - name: Prints various Ansible facts
      debug:
        msg: >
          The running Kernel of {{ ansible_hostname }}
          is {{ ansible_kernel }}
      delegate_to: web0
...
----
